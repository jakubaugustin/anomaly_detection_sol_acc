# Real-time IoT robust anomaly detection framework

With rapid digitalization of the economy, we experience exponential growth of real time data being processed by businesses and organizations worldwide. Lots of new observations depict critical metrics, measurements and KPIs that carry essential information about current state of underlying asset, ranging from infrastructure and machinery sensor readings to number of transactions in the online shop. This big data needs to be monitored in real time as sometimes only timely alerting and following rapid action may mitigate risks, lead to new identified business opportunities or decreased potential costs. For example, operating a wind park and collecting sensor readings from the turbine motor allows us to find broken turbines. Finding the broken machine promptly and providing mechanics with the latest information will significantly reduce the costs (fixing it soon and returning to normal electricity generation) and speed up the repair process.
